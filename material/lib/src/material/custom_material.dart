/// A piece of material.
///
/// The Material widget is responsible for:
///
/// 1. Clipping: If [clipBehavior] is not [Clip.none], Material clips its widget
///    sub-tree to the shape specified by [shape], [type], and [borderRadius].
///    By default, [clipBehavior] is [Clip.none] for performance considerations.
///    See [Ink] for an example of how this affects clipping [Ink] widgets.
/// 2. Elevation: Material elevates its widget sub-tree on the Z axis by
///    [elevation] pixels, and draws the appropriate shadow.
/// 3. Ink effects: Material shows ink effects implemented by [InkFeature]s
///    like [InkSplash] and [InkHighlight] below its children.
///
/// ## The Material Metaphor
///
/// Material is the central metaphor in Material Design. Each piece of material
/// exists at a given elevation, which influences how that piece of material
/// visually relates to other pieces of material and how that material casts
/// shadows.
///
/// Most user interface elements are either conceptually printed on a piece of
/// material or themselves made of material. Material reacts to user input using
/// [InkSplash] and [InkHighlight] effects. To trigger a reaction on the
/// material, use a [MaterialInkController] obtained via [Material.of].
///
/// In general, the features of a [Material] should not change over time (e.g. a
/// [Material] should not change its [color], [shadowColor] or [type]).
/// Changes to [elevation], [shadowColor] and [surfaceTintColor] are animated
/// for [animationDuration]. Changes to [shape] are animated if [type] is
/// not [MaterialType.transparency] and [ShapeBorder.lerp] between the previous
/// and next [shape] values is supported. Shape changes are also animated
/// for [animationDuration].
///
/// ## Shape
///
/// The shape for material is determined by [shape], [type], and [borderRadius].
///
///  - If [shape] is non null, it determines the shape.
///  - If [shape] is null and [borderRadius] is non null, the shape is a
///    rounded rectangle, with corners specified by [borderRadius].
///  - If [shape] and [borderRadius] are null, [type] determines the
///    shape as follows:
///    - [MaterialType.canvas]: the default material shape is a rectangle.
///    - [MaterialType.card]: the default material shape is a rectangle with
///      rounded edges. The edge radii is specified by [kMaterialEdges].
///    - [MaterialType.circle]: the default material shape is a circle.
///    - [MaterialType.button]: the default material shape is a rectangle with
///      rounded edges. The edge radii is specified by [kMaterialEdges].
///    - [MaterialType.transparency]: the default material shape is a rectangle.
///
/// ## Border
///
/// If [shape] is not null, then its border will also be painted (if any).
///
/// ## Layout change notifications
///
/// If the layout changes (e.g. because there's a list on the material, and it's
/// been scrolled), a [LayoutChangedNotification] must be dispatched at the
/// relevant subtree. This in particular means that transitions (e.g.
/// [SlideTransition]) should not be placed inside [Material] widgets so as to
/// move subtrees that contain [InkResponse]s, [InkWell]s, [Ink]s, or other
/// widgets that use the [InkFeature] mechanism. Otherwise, in-progress ink
/// features (e.g., ink splashes and ink highlights) won't move to account for
/// the new layout.
///
/// ## Painting over the material
///
/// Material widgets will often trigger reactions on their nearest material
/// ancestor. For example, [ListTile.hoverColor] triggers a reaction on the
/// tile's material when a pointer is hovering over it. These reactions will be
/// obscured if any widget in between them and the material paints in such a
/// way as to obscure the material (such as setting a [BoxDecoration.color] on
/// a [DecoratedBox]). To avoid this behavior, use [InkDecoration] to decorate
/// the material itself.
